# MAGIC ### Tuning, Validating and Saving
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In earlier lessons, we addressed the methodological mistake of training _and_ evaluating a model on the same data.  This leads to **overfitting,** where the model performs well on data it has already seen but fails to predict anything useful on data it has not already seen.  To solve this, we proposed the train/test split where we divided our dataset between a training set used to train the model and a test set used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.  In this lesson, we will explore a more rigorous solution to problem of overfitting.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A **hyperparameter** is a parameter used in a machine learning algorithm that is set before the learning process begins.  In other words, a machine learning algorithm cannot learn hyperparameters from the data itself.  Hyperparameters need to be tested and validated by training multiple models.  Common hyperparameters include the number of iterations and the complexity of the model.  **Hyperparameter tuning** is the process of choosing the hyperparameter that performs the best on our loss function, or the way we penalize an algorithm for being wrong.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If we were to train a number of different models with different hyperparameters and then evaluate their performance on the test set, we would still risk overfitting because we might choose the hyperparameter that just so happens to perform the best on the data we have in our dataset.  To solve this, we can use _k_ subsets of our training set to train our model, a process called **_k_-fold cross-validation.**

# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lesson, we will divide our dataset into _k_ "folds" in order to choose the best hyperparameters for our machine learning model.  We will then save the trained model and its predictions.

# MAGIC ### Hyperparameter Tuning
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Hyperparameter tuning is the process of of choosing the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm.  Each algorithm has different hyperparameters to tune.  You can explore these hyperparameters by using the `.explainParams()` method on a model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Grid search** is the process of exhaustively trying every combination of hyperparameters.  It takes all of the values we want to test and combines them in every possible way so that we test them using cross-validation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Start by performing a train/test split on the Boston dataset and building a pipeline for linear regression.

# MAGIC `ParamGridBuilder()` allows us to string together all of the different possible hyperparameters we would like to test.  In this case, we can test the maximum number of iterations, whether we want to use an intercept with the y axis, and whether we want to standardize our features.

# MAGIC ### Cross-Validation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are a number of different ways of conducting cross-validation, allowing us to trade off between computational expense and model performance.  An exhaustive approach to cross-validation would include every possible split of the training set.  More commonly, _k_-fold cross-validation is used where the training dataset is divided into _k_ smaller sets, or folds.  A model is then trained on _k_-1 folds of the training data and the last fold is used to evaluate its performance.
